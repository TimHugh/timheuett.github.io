## Intro

This is the source for my personal website, at [TimHeuett.com](http://www.timheuett.com).

<!-- Built on Sinatra, with a Sprockets-powered asset pipeline, and other stuff like SLIM templates and SASS.

## Usage

The port and environment need to be set in a `.env` file in the project root:

    PORT=3000
    RACK_ENV=development

Then, just `bundle` and `bundle exec foreman start` -->
